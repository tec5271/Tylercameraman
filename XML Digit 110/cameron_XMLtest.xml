    <poem>
        <line n="1">I met a traveller from an antique land,</line>
        <line n="2">Who said—Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</line>
        <line n="3">Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,</line>
        <line n="4">Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</line>
        <line n="5">&amp; wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</line><!-- ampersand was not marked up correctly to be within XML -->
        <line n="6">Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</line>
        <line n="7">Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</line><!-- line end tag missing -->
        <line n="8">The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;</line>
        <line n="9">And on the pedestal, these words appear:</line><!-- missing a white space between the line and n -->
        <line n="10">My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;</line>
        <line n="11">Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!</line>
        <line n="12">Nothing beside remains. Round the decay</line>
        <line n="13">Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare</line>
        <line n="14">The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</line><!-- end tag had the slash at the end instead of the beginning -->
