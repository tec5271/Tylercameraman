    <lb n="1"/>From fairest creatures we desire increase,
    <lb n="2"/>That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
    <lb n="3"/>But as the riper should by time decease,
    <lb n="4"/>His tender heir might bear his memory:
    <lb n="5"/>But thou contracted to thine own bright eyes,
    <lb n="6"/>Feed'st thy light's flame with self-substantial fuel,
    <lb n="7"/>Making a famine where abundance lies,
    <lb n="8"/>Thy self thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel:
    <lb n="9"/>Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament,
    <lb n="10"/>And only herald to the gaudy spring,
    <lb n="11"/>Within thine own bud buriest thy content,
    <lb n="12"/>And tender churl mak'st waste in niggarding:
    <lb n="13"/>Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
    <lb n="14"/>To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.

  <poem num="II">
    <lb n="1"/>When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,
    <lb n="2"/>And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
    <lb n="3"/>Thy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,
    <lb n="4"/>Will be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:
    <lb n="5"/>Then being asked, where all thy beauty lies,
    <lb n="6"/>Where all the treasure of thy lusty days;
    <lb n="7"/>To say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,
    <lb n="8"/>Were an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.
    <lb n="9"/>How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,
    <lb n="10"/>If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
    <lb n="11"/>Shall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'
    <lb n="12"/>Proving his beauty by succession thine!
    <lb n="13"/>This were to be new made when thou art old,
    <lb n="14"/>And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.

  <poem num="III">
    <lb n="1"/>Look in thy glass and tell the face thou viewest
    <lb n="2"/>Now is the time that face should form another;
    <lb n="3"/>Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
    <lb n="4"/>Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
    <lb n="5"/>For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
    <lb n="6"/>Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
    <lb n="7"/>Or who is he so fond will be the tomb,
    <lb n="8"/>Of his self-love to stop posterity?
    <lb n="9"/>Thou art thy mother's glass and she in thee
    <lb n="10"/>Calls back the lovely April of her prime;
    <lb n="11"/>So thou through windows of thine age shalt see,
    <lb n="12"/>Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.

    <lb n="14"/>Die single and thine image dies with thee.

  <poem num="IV">
    <lb n="1"/>Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
    <lb n="2"/>Upon thy self thy beauty's legacy?
    <lb n="3"/>Nature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,
    <lb n="4"/>And being frank she lends to those are free:
    <lb n="5"/>Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
    <lb n="6"/>The bounteous largess given thee to give?
    <lb n="7"/>Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
    <lb n="8"/>So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
    <lb n="9"/>For having traffic with thy self alone,
    <lb n="10"/>Thou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:
    <lb n="11"/>Then how when nature calls thee to be gone,
    <lb n="12"/>What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
    <lb n="13"/>Thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,
    <lb n="14"/>Which, used, lives th' executor to be.

    <lb n="1"/>Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
    <lb n="2"/>The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,

    <lb n="5"/>For never-resting time leads summer on
    <lb n="6"/>To hideous winter, and confounds him there;
    <lb n="7"/>Sap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,
    <lb n="8"/>Beauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:
    <lb n="9"/>Then were not summer's distillation left,
    <lb n="10"/>A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
    <lb n="11"/>Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
    <lb n="12"/>Nor it, nor no remembrance what it was:

    <lb n="14"/>Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.

  <poem num="VI">
    <lb n="1"/>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface,

    <lb n="4"/>With beauty's treasure ere it be self-kill'd.
    <lb n="5"/>That use is not forbidden usury,
    <lb n="6"/>Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
    <lb n="7"/>That's for thy self to breed another thee,
    <lb n="8"/>Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
    <lb n="9"/>Ten times thy self were happier than thou art,
    <lb n="10"/>If ten of thine ten times refigur'd thee:
    <lb n="11"/>Then what could death do if thou shouldst depart,
    <lb n="12"/>Leaving thee living in posterity?
    <lb n="13"/>Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair

    <lb n="1"/>Lo! in the orient when the gracious light

    <lb n="6"/>Resembling strong youth in his middle age,

    <lb n="10"/>Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,

    <lb n="1"/>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?

    <lb n="4"/>Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
    <lb n="5"/>If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
    <lb n="6"/>By unions married, do offend thine ear,
    <lb n="7"/>They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
    <lb n="8"/>In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
    <lb n="9"/>Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
    <lb n="10"/>Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
    <lb n="11"/>Resembling sire and child and happy mother,
    <lb n="12"/>Who, all in one, one pleasing note do sing:

    <lb n="7"/>Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate

    <lb n="1"/>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou grow'st,

    <lb n="6"/>Without this folly, age, and cold decay:

    <lb n="8"/>And threescore year would make the world away.

    <lb n="5"/>When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,
    <lb n="6"/>Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
    <lb n="7"/>And summer's green all girded up in sheaves,
    <lb n="8"/>Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
    <lb n="9"/>Then of thy beauty do I question make,
    <lb n="10"/>That thou among the wastes of time must go,
    <lb n="11"/>Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
    <lb n="12"/>And die as fast as they see others grow;
    <lb n="13"/>And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence

    <lb n="7"/>Yourself again, after yourself's decease,
    <lb n="8"/>When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
    <lb n="9"/>Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,

    <lb n="9"/>Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
    <lb n="10"/>Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
    <lb n="11"/>Where wasteful Time debateth with decay
    <lb n="12"/>To change your day of youth to sullied night,
    <lb n="13"/>And all in war with Time for love of you,
    <lb n="14"/>As he takes from you, I engraft you new.

  <poem num="XVI">
    <lb n="1"/>But wherefore do not you a mightier way

    <lb n="8"/>Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
    <lb n="9"/>So should the lines of life that life repair,
    <lb n="10"/>Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
    <lb n="11"/>Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
    <lb n="12"/>Can make you live your self in eyes of men.
    <lb n="13"/>To give away yourself, keeps yourself still,
    <lb n="14"/>And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.

    <lb n="4"/>Which hides your life, and shows not half your parts.
    <lb n="5"/>If I could write the beauty of your eyes,
    <lb n="6"/>And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
    <lb n="7"/>The age to come would say 'This poet lies;

    <lb n="5"/>Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,

    <lb n="10"/>The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
    <lb n="11"/>I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
    <lb n="12"/>And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
    <lb n="13"/>But found no cure, the bath for my help lies
    <lb n="14"/>Where Cupid got new fire; my mistress' eyes.

  <poem num="CLIV">
    <lb n="1"/>The little Love-god lying once asleep,
    <lb n="2"/>Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
    <lb n="3"/>Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
    <lb n="4"/>Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
    <lb n="5"/>The fairest votary took up that fire
    <lb n="6"/>Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
    <lb n="7"/>And so the general of hot desire
    <lb n="8"/>Was, sleeping, by a virgin hand disarm'd.
    <lb n="9"/>This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
    <lb n="10"/>Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
    <lb n="11"/>Growing a bath and healthful remedy,
    <lb n="12"/>For men diseas'd; but I, my mistress' thrall,
    <lb n="13"/>Came there for cure and this by that I prove,
    <lb n="14"/>Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.
