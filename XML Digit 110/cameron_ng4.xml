    <title type="intro">Gingersnaps</title>

    <introduction>These crunchy, spicy rounds with their cracked, sugary tops are equally at home
        dunked in tea, coffee, or milk, and frequently enjoyed during the November/December holiday
        season. But they're just as welcome on a mellow, golden, late-September afternoon, with a
        comfortable lounge chair and a large glass of fresh-squeezed lemonade.</introduction>

    <directions depth="explained">
        <step follow="heat">Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two
            baking sheets.</step>

        <step follow="action">Beat together the shortening,<ingred> sugar,</ingred>
            <ingred>salt,</ingred> and <ingred>baking soda.</ingred></step>

        <step follow="action">Beat in the egg, then the molasses.</step>

        <step follow="action">Add the <ingred>flour</ingred> and <ingred>spices,</ingred> beating to
            make a smooth, fairly stiff dough.</step>

        <step follow="howTo">To make the coating, combine the <ingred>sugar</ingred> and
                <ingred>cinnamon,</ingred> and place in a shallow pan or dish.</step>

        <step follow="action">Drop the dough in 1" balls into the cinnamon-sugar mixture; a teaspoon
            cookie scoop is perfect here.</step>

        <step follow="action">Roll the balls in the sugar to coat, then transfer them to the
            prepared baking sheets, leaving at least 1 1/2" between them; they'll spread as they
            bake.</step>

        <step follow="heat">Bake the cookies for <time amount="minutes">11 minutes,</time> for
            cookies that are crisp around the edges, and "bendy" in the center. Bake for <time
                amount="minutes">13 minutes,</time> for cookies that are crisp/crunchy all the way
            through.</step>

        <step follow="action">Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool right on the pan, or on a
            rack. Cool completely, then store tightly wrapped, at room temperature.</step>
