            <strong>A little bit about me</strong> </h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Tyler Cameron I am currently a student at Penn State Brandywine until the end of the 2021 spring semester. After that semester I will be moving to Penn State Behrend to finish my Junior and Senior years. My field of study is within the DIGIT program and the exact major is Digital media, arts, and technology. I originally had chosen Energy, Business, Finance as my major, but my love for photography and media drove me to make a switch. </p>
        <p>Like I said in the previous paragraph photography is one of my passions. I picked up my first DSLR camera back in 2016 since then I have fallen in love with the art of creating images. Before picking up my first DSLR I had my cell phone as well as my Momâ€™s point and shoot camera which I always enjoyed picking up and fiddling with. Fast forward to present day I now use my photography skills as a way to relax, and to also have a source of income. With this I am also practicing my social media skills with my own personal Photography pages on multiple platforms.<p>
        <p>A step away from my life outside of school and a step into my life while at school. I am not one to get involved very often, but in Fall of 2019 I started my Freshman year and decided to find at least two ways to get involved. I first found the Brandywine Cross Country team. This would be my first time running for a team since middle school and it reopened my love for running. This was also a source of friendships and support. The second activity I found was the Photography club. I had signed up at the involvement fair and the President of the club would soon become my best friend and I would become the vice president. Following the 2020 spring semester I would take over as President of the club and run it through the covid-19 school year of 2020-2021.</p>
