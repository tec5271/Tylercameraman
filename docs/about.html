            <strong>A little bit about me</strong> </h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is Tyler Cameron I am currently a student at Penn State Brandywine until the end of the 2021 spring semester. After that semester I will be moving to Penn State Behrend to finish my Junior and Senior years. My field of study is within the DIGIT program and the exact major is Digital media, arts, and technology. I originally had chosen Energy, Business, Finance as my major, but my love for photography and media drove me to make a switch. </p>
