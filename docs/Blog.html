    <h4>Our Goal</h4>
    <p>When my buddy and I were coming together to form this club we wanted it to be a space for
        other creators to feel welcomed no matter their experience in the hobby. We want to be
        able to offer advice where we feel that we are knowledgeable enough to give and if there
        are others that know more than we do we encourage them to speak up as well. Creators are
        can often be hesitant when putting out content so this little club family that we have;
        our hope is people feel comfortable enough to start sharing within the group. With all
        of this teaching cannot only be done verbally in photography, one must go out and take
        photos so as a club there are organized meetings to practice skills that are learned
        throughout the semester.</p>
    <h4>Events</h4>
    <p>There have been multiple types of events throughout our club history. We have organized
        photoshoots with our members. During these shoots we have gone to the city and used one
        another as models to practice portrait shots. There were also plenty of opportunities
        during these to practice city scape and architecture pictures. We held 2 meetings a
        month where we would gather and talk about topics that members wanted to learn. These
        request would then be turned into presentations and presented at following meetings.
        Collectively the club would edit photos on the screen bouncing ideas around making the
        photo look clean and crisp. </p>
    <h4>Services</h4>
    <p>As a club we know that other clubs, faculty, or even the campus in general may sometimes
        need a service provided. For example, this 2020 Fall semester I have done photoshoots
        for the Dance and Chess club. We also want to start offering headshots for LinkedIn and
        other business oriented photos. These services are usually requested and we will
        evaluate if we are open to doing it or not. We try not to put a label on what we are
        willing to do because of the need to try newer things. </p>
    <h4>How it got Started</h4>
    <p>The club was originally started by my friend Shiv Patel back in Fall of 2019. Him and I
        came to campus looking for a photography club only to find that there was not one to
        join. He ended up getting the ball rolling before I could and making it into the
        involvement fair where he gathered a large number of email addresses from students
        interested in our club. This is when I myself also signed up and ended up snapchatting
        Shiv about the first meeting. From there him and I were always on the same page which
        made the President and Vice President seats very easy to establish. This is when the
        emails started being sent out and the people who responded would become club members and
        some even became other club officers. To this day we still are trying to gather new
        students through different forms of promotion on campus and online.</p>
    <h4>What we know</h4>
    <p> From an entry level outlook Shiv and I are able to help anyone that wants to learn even
        with a cell phone the basics of photography. This includes: lighting, composition, and
        post processing. With these three basic elements a person can take their shots to the
        next level. Not to say that one will perfect these quickly but there will be early rapid
        growth after understanding them. Taking things a different direction to the gear side of
        the conversation; Shiv and I have different preferences for certain technology. Shiv is
        very much into the Sony brand and would be able to teach that brand better than I could.
        I personally am fond of the Canon product line and would have a better grip on the ropes
        of their cameras. We both understand how to use phone cameras and adobe services (for
        editing purposes).</p>
