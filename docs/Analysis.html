            <figcaption>The two hiram documents under investigation on antconc with a specified three to five N-gram search came up with a lot of results that showed a set theme for the characters of the story. With phrases such as: “hurry up phosphorus” and “kernel hurry up” it seems that the characters in this set of hiram radio plays are always lagging behind. What really surprised me was the number of times a plant of sorts was mentioned in these phrases. The fruit lime was mentioned, as well as tobacco. There were a lot of instances where cultivation was even said. So this leads me to believe some sort of farm is in the works or they are located near one. The use of the word “midwest” is frequent as well which supports the farm location idea. Midwest popped up when switching the minimum N-Grams to one to three rather than the three to five. After looking for frequent things with antconc I dove into the lesser repeating things and found that “bushels” and “harvesting” were sprinkled throughout giving this farming idea closure. There was no doubt from the analysis through antconc that I found myself a set scene and storyline of sorts.</figcaption>
