            <figcaption>The two hiram documents under investigation on antconc with a specified three to five N-gram search came up with a lot of results that showed a set theme for the characters of the story. With phrases such as: “hurry up phosphorus” and “kernel hurry up” it seems that the characters in this set of hiram radio plays are always lagging behind. What really surprised me was the number of times a plant of sorts was mentioned in these phrases. The fruit lime was mentioned, as well as tobacco. There were a lot of instances where cultivation was even said. So this leads me to believe some sort of farm is in the works or they are located near one. The use of the word “midwest” is frequent as well which supports the farm location idea. Midwest popped up when switching the minimum N-Grams to one to three rather than the three to five. After looking for frequent things with antconc I dove into the lesser repeating things and found that “bushels” and “harvesting” were sprinkled throughout giving this farming idea closure. There was no doubt from the analysis through antconc that I found myself a set scene and storyline of sorts.</figcaption>

            <figcaption>When analyzing through voyant I wasn’t sure if the change from clusters of words to standalone words would change my findings. So, I was interested to see what would change, if anything at all. The words that translated over from antconc to voyant were really no surprise. “Hiram”, “Midwest”, and “Lime” even managed to sneak into the top 25 words on the list. What surprised me was “nitrogen” appearing. Because in antconc “hurry up phosphorus” was an N-gram that appeared frequently. Was this a form of names in the story? Using elements from the periodic table seems a little out of place for a story of what seems to be about farming. I did not know what to make of these element names until further investigation. When singling out these terms, sure enough, there were sentence structures that would point to these elemental names being peoples names in the story. Moving on from that, words like “crops”, “hired”, and “hands”  were used quite commonly in these texts. And when looking each one up they are seen being used together to form “hired hands”. This is a phrase that tends to be used when talking about heavy labor. That and “crops' ' being found on voyant clarified my understanding of these radio plays. </figcaption>
